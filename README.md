# Space_Tanks
**Year 2582 :** The last exodus ship took its flight. It's been over a decade since we have been moving people to Asgardia, our spacestead. We would have never left our planet if the crisis would have never happended but we were destined for something else. We have left our home, our planet, the earth. Gradually the crisis took form of a war and most of the land was unhabitable. The remaining poppulation has been shifted to Asgardia until we find a permanent home.

**Year 3125 :** The mankind has reached its new home, planet kepler-1606b. It is one among a few other habitable planets of the universe. Our ships had just landed on the surface when we found a fleet of warships invading into the atmoshepre. We thought it was a fleet of refugees like us. We were planing to share the planet with them but they started a war against  us. They were a collation of human like spices who plunder different planets and use it a temporary homestead. Thanks to the almighty we had been preparing ourselves with a small fleet of space tanks to protect ourselves from enemies. Now its a war of civilizations and we can't step back. This is our last hope of survival.
